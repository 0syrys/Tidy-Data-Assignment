# CodeBook

## Data Processing

+ Data from training and test datasets were merged
+ Only data including "std()" or "mean()" were used for the summary
+ Column names were modified for better readability
+ The activity data was changed from numerical values to the corresponding activites
+ The mean of the dataset was calculated for each combination of activity and subject
+ Epxorted as the *"tidy.Rda"* data set
